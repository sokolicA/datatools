# Data Manipulation Tools

## TODO

DataFrame:

- add number of last updated rows after eval .Last.updated ?

- can this be done in Cpp? str2lang(paste0("c(", paste0("'", cols, "'", collapse = ","), ")"))

StatFrame:

- Add correlations.

- Think about adding `Missing` class

- Think about adding ggplot support.
